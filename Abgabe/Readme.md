# Systemproject - Exploring the Bitcoin P2P network
This systemproject has been developed during the seminar "Cryptography and Data security". The topic of the semester FS2022 was **Blockchain Privacy**.

This systemproject consists of following files:
* `Exploring_the_Bitcoin_P2P_network.pdf` file contains the presentation slides
* `GetAddr_Presentation.ipynb` file is Jupyter notebook, which showcases the Bitcoin P2P protocol.
* `P2P_Visualization.ipynb` file is a Jupyter notebook, which contains the Bitcoin P2P network analysis.
* The folder `test_framework` contains 3rd party libraries, which is used in `GetAddr_Presentation.ipynb`.

## Usage
You can run all the Jupyter notebooks either on your [local Jupyter instance](https://jupyter.org/install) or on [Google Collab platform](https://colab.research.google.com/). After you have opened the jupyter notebooks, you can execute each code block one by one or all at once.
The jupyter notebook `GetAddr_Presentation.ipynb` has been tested on a local jupyter instance and `P2P_Visualization.ipynb` has been tested on Google Collab.
